# InventoryApp
This is the tenth and final project I've submitted to Udacity for the Android Basics NanoDegree. The main criteria of the Project is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.
